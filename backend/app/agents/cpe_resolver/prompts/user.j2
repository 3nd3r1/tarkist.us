Please analyze the following entity data and generate CPE identifiers for vulnerability searching:

Entity Data:
{{ entity_data }}

Generate multiple CPE variations that could be used to find CVEs for this product/vendor combination. Consider:

1. Primary CPE using exact vendor and product names
2. Alternative vendor name variations (abbreviations, common aliases)
3. Alternative product name variations (short names, common references)
4. Any other reasonable variations that might appear in vulnerability databases

For each CPE, provide:
- vendor: The vendor name portion of the CPE
- product: The product name portion of the CPE  
- full_cpe: The complete CPE string in standard format

Return a JSON object following the provided schema with an array of CPE identifiers.

Ensure the response is valid JSON that matches the schema exactly.
